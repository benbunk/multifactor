This is a module to support adding multifactor authentication to Drupal.

It's currently designed to either call and verify a known PIN or to text and provide a random PIN that is entered into
Drupal during the login process.

This project needs to be split into three parts:
1. Core hooks to support other modules implementing multifactor authentication.
2. Text based multifactor authentication module implementing the core hooks.
3. Voice based multifactor authentication module implementing the core hooks.
